## Basic module usage

### The `seq` module

For the purpose of this tutorial, we are going to use the toy module
`utils/seq`, which is implemented in the file [`utils/seq.r`](utils/seq.r).
The module implements some very basic mechanisms to deal with DNA sequences
(character strings consisting entirely of the letters `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`).

First, we load the module.

```{r}
seq = import('utils/seq')
ls()
```

`utils` serves as a supermodule here, which groups several submodules (but for
now, `seq` is the only one).

To see which functions a module exports, use `ls`:

```{r}
ls(seq)
```

And we can display interactive help for individual functions:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?seq$seq
```

This function creates a biological sequence. We can use it:

```{r}
s = seq$seq(c(foo = 'GATTACAGATCAGCTCAGCACCTAGCACTATCAGCAAC',
              bar = 'CATAGCAACTGACATCACAGCG'))
s
```

Notice how we get a pretty-printed,
[FASTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)-like output because the
`print` method is redefined for the `seq` class in `utils/seq`:

```{r}
seq$print.seq
```

### Attaching modules

That’s it for basic usage. In order to understand more about the module
mechanism, let’s look at an alternative usage:

```{r}
# We can unload loaded modules that we assigned to an identifier:
unload(seq)

options(import.path = 'utils')
import('seq', attach = TRUE)
```

After unloading the already loaded module, the `options` function call sets
the module search path: this is where `import` searches for modules. If more
than one path is given, `import` searches them all until a module of matching
name is found.

The `import` statement can now simply specify `seq` instead of `utils/seq` as
the module name. We also specify `attach=TRUE`. This has an effect similar to
package loading (or `attach`ing an environment): all the module’s names are
now available for direct use without necessitating the `seq$` qualifier.

However, unlike the `attach` function, module attachment happens *in local
scope* only. Since the above code was executed in global scope, there’s no
distinction between local and global scope:

```{r}
search()
```

Notice the second position, which reads “`r search()[2]`”. But now let’s undo
that, and attach (and use) the module locally instead.

```{r}
detach('module:seq') # Name is optional
local({
    import('seq', attach = TRUE)
    table('GATTACA')
})
```

Note that this uses `seq`’s `table` function, rather than `base::table` (which
would have a different output). Furthermore, note that *outside* the local
scope, the module is not attached:

```{r}
search()
table('GATTACA')
```

This is very powerful, as it isolates separate scopes more effectively than
the `attach` function. What is more, modules which are imported and attached
inside another module *remain* inside that module and are not visible outside
the module by default.

Nevertheless, the normal, recommended usage of a module is with `attach=FALSE`
(the default), as this makes it clearer which names we are referring to.

### Nested modules

Modules can also be nested in hierarchies. In fact, here is the implementation
of `utils` (in [`utils/__init__.r`](utils/__init__.r): since `utils` is a
directory rather than a file, the module implementation resides in the nested
file `__init__.r`):

```{r file='utils/__init__.r'}
```

The submodule is specified as `'./seq'` rather than `'seq'`: the
explicitly provided relative path prevents lookup in the import search path
(that we set via `options(import.path=…)` earlier); instead, only the current
directory is considered.

We can now use the `utils` module:

```{r}
options(import.path = NULL) # Reset search path
utils = import('utils')
ls(utils)
ls(utils$seq)
utils$seq$revcomp('CAT')
```

We could also have implemented `utils` as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
export_submodule('./seq')
```

This would have made all of `seq`’s definitions immediately available in
`utils`. This is sometimes useful, but should be employed with care.

### Implementing modules

`utils/seq.r` is, by and large, a normal R source file. In fact, there are only
two things worth mentioning:

1. Documentation. Each function in the module file is documented using the
   [roxygen2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html)
   syntax. It works the same as for packages. The *modules* package parses the
   documentation and makes it available via `module_help` and `?`.

2. The module exports [S3 functions](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html). The
   *modules* package takes care to register such functions automatically but
   this only works for *user generics* that are defined inside the same module.
   When overriding “known generics” (such as `print`), we need to register
   these manually via `register_S3_method` (this is necessary since these
   functions are inherently ambiguous and there is no automatic way of finding
   them).

Module files can contain arbitrary code. It is executed when loaded for the
first time: subsequent `import`s in the same session, regardless of whether they
occur in a different scope, will refer to the loaded, cached module, and will
*not* reload a module.

We can illustrate this by loading a module which has side-effects, `'info'`.

```{r file='info.r'}
```

Let’s load it:

```{r}
info = import('info')
```

We have imported the module, and get the diagnostic messages. Let’s re-import
the module:

```{r}
import('info')
```

… no messages are displayed. However, we can explicitly *reload* a module. This
clears the cache, and loads the module again:

```{r}
reload(info)
```

And this displays the messages again. The `reload` function is a shortcut for
`unload` followed by `import` (using the exact same arguments as used on the
original `import` call).

The `info` module also show-cases two important helper functions:

1. `module_name` contains the name of the module with which it was loaded. This
   is especially handy because outside of a module `module_name` is `NULL`. We
   can harness this in a similar way to Python’s `__name__` mechanism.

2. `module_file` works equivalently to `system.file`: it returns the full path
   to any file within a module. This is helpful when distributing data files
   with modules, which are loaded from within the module. When invoked without
   arguments, `module_file` returns the full path to the directory containing
   the module source file.
