The need for tools to make R code more modular, and to improve code reuse, is
demonstrated by the wealth of related packages that have sprung up over the
years. Many of them have objectives similar to ‘box’, although they vary wildly
in how they approach their common goal, and not all objectives are shared. In
the following I’ve listed the related R packages that I know of. The
descriptions are (mostly) copied from the respective package metadata, and the
interested reader is invited to consult the original documentation.

The list is intended to be a fairly exhaustive — so if you find a missing
package please let me know.

## Tools for writing modular code

* ‘**[modules][]**’ (no relation to the predecessor of ‘box’, also called
  ‘modules’): Provides modules as an organizational unit for source code.
  Modules enforce to be more rigorous when defining dependencies and have a
  local search path. They can be used as a sub unit within packages or in
  scripts.

* ‘[trinker/**pysty**][pysty]’: ‘Python’ style packages importing using the
  common forms of: `import PACKAGE`, `import PACKAGE as ALIAS`, or `from PACKAGE
  import FUN1, FUN2, FUN_N`.

* ‘[**Shiny**’ modules][Shiny]: ‘Shiny’ modules address the namespacing problem
  in Shiny UI and server logic, adding a level of abstraction beyond functions.

* ‘[Novartis/**tidymodules**][tidymodules]’: ‘tidymodules’ offers a robust
  framework for developing ‘Shiny’ modules based on R6 classes which should
  facilitates inter-modules communication.

* ‘**[supreme][]**’: A modeling tool helping users better structure ‘Shiny’
  applications developed with ‘Shiny’ modules. Users are able to: 1. Visualize
  relationship of modules in existing applications 2. Design new applications
  from scratch.


## Tools for loading code

The packages listed above also provide means for loading code; however, I won’t
replicate them here. Some of the tools below have subsequently also gained
capabilities for authoring modular code, but since their initial and primary
purpose was *loading* code, they’re instead listed below.

* ‘**[import][]**’: Alternative mechanism for importing objects from packages
  and R modules. The syntax allows for importing multiple objects with a single
  command in an expressive way. The import package bridges some of the gap
  between using library (or require) and direct (single-object) imports.
  Furthermore the imported objects are not placed in the current environment.

* ‘**[conflicted][]**’: R's default conflict management system gives the most
  recently loaded package precedence. This can make it hard to detect conflicts,
  particularly when they arise because a package update creates ambiguity that
  did not previously exist. 'conflicted' takes a different approach, making
  every conflict an error and forcing you to choose which function to use.

* ‘**[pacman][]**’: Tools to more conveniently perform tasks associated with
  add-on packages. pacman conveniently wraps library and package related
  functions and names them in an intuitive and consistent fashion. It seeks to
  combine functionality from lower level functions which can speed up workflow.

* ‘[jonocarroll/**importAs**][importAs]’: Import namespaces as shorthand symbols
  rather than full package names, in a python-esque fashion.

* ‘[**needs**][needs]’: A simple function for easier package loading
  and auto-installation.

* ‘[**importar**][importar]’: Enables ‘Python’-like importing/loading
  of packages or functions with aliasing to prevent namespace conflicts.

* [**xfun**::pkg_attach()][xfun]: A vectorized version of `library()`


## Tools for organising code

* ‘**[RSuite][]**’: Supports safe and reproducible solutions development in R.
  It will help you with environment separation per project, dependency
  management, local packages creation and preparing deployment packs for your
  solutions. (Archived as of `r Sys.Date()`)

* ‘**[mvbutils][]**’: Hierarchical workspace tree, code editing and backup, easy
  package prep, editing of packages while loaded, per-object lazy-loading, easy
  documentation, macro functions, and miscellaneous utilities.
