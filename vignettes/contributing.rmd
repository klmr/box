# Installation

Compared to many other R packages, ‘box’ uses a somewhat different development workflow:

While ‘box’ uses ‘devtools’ and ‘roxygen2’ to generate documentation and package infrastructure, *generated code and data is not checked into version control!* This means in particular that the project does not contain a `NAMESPACE` file, since that is auto-(re)generated by tools. Therefore, attempting to install the current development version of ‘box’ via `pak::pak('klmr/box')` or equivalent means *will fail!*

Instead, an up-to-date, automatically generated build of the development version of ‘box’ should be installed from [R-Universe](https://klmr.r-universe.dev/):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('box', repos = 'https://klmr.r-universe.dev')
```

… or from the corresponding `build` branch:

```{r eval = FALSE}
pak::pak('klmr/box@build')
```

Alternatively it can be built manually using the instructions below.


# Development

## Building

The project contains a `Makefile` written in the [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) dialect that contains various development utilities. Invoking `make` without target will show a list of available targets with short descriptions. Using this `Makefile` isn’t *necessary*, but it helps. In particular:

* `make documentation` builds the `NAMESPACE` file, the shared C library and the package documentation.
* `make test` runs the unit tests.
* `make check` runs checks, and should run cleanly before submitting a pull request: of note, `make check` performs additional checks that are not performed by either `R CMD check` or `rcmdcheck::rcmdcheck()` (these checks can be found as individual scripts under `scripts/`; they roughly correspond to some undocumented checks performed internally on CRAN).


## Branches

All new code should be developed on a new branch with a name prefixed `fix/` (for bug fixes), `feature/` (for new features/enhancements), and `chore/` (for any other contributions: fixed typos, project infrastructure, tests, etc.). Branches for pull requests will be merged into the [`main` branch](https://github.com/klmr/box/tree/main).


## Code style

The code style of ‘box’ is similar to the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/), but with several notable differences:

* The file extension for R code files is lowercase `.r` (not uppercase `.R`). The file extension for R Markdown files is lowercase `.rmd` (not uppercase `.Rmd`).

  <div class="rationale">**Rationale:** using capital letters in file extensions is a pointless violation of established convention that creates unnecessary inconsistencies.</div>

* Use `=` for assignment, not `<-`.
    * On the (very rare!) occasions where assignment inside a function call is required, use additional parentheses to make `=` syntactically an assignment rather than named argument passing.

        ```{r eval = FALSE}
        # GOOD:
        x = 5

        # OK (rarely):
        if (is.null((x = function_call()))) {}

        # BAD:
        x <- 5
        if (is.null(x <- function_call())) {}
        ```

    * `<<-` is banned. Instead of `name <<- value`, use `env$name = value`, where `env` is a previously-defined name referring to the desired target environment. This pattern is used in various places in the code, and good, context-dependent names for `env` are `ns`, `self`, or similar. `assign()` should generally not be used when the name of the assignee is statically known.

        ```{r eval = FALSE}
        # GOOD:
        self = parent.frame()
        # … later, inside a nested closure:
        self$x = TRUE

        # BAD:
        x <<- TRUE

        # BAD:
        assign('x', TRUE, envir = caller)
        ```

        <div class="rationale">**Rationale:** `<<-` leaves it unclear where assignment will happen. Subset-assignment via `$` makes the assignment target scope explicit, which makes the code clearer and less error-prone.</div>

* Leave a space between `function` and the following opening parenthesis.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    # GOOD:
    f = function () {}

    # BAD:
    f = function() {}
    ```

   <div class="rationale">**Rationale:** a function declaration in R does not use function call syntax; rather, it’s a special syntactic construct equivalent to `if` and `while`, so the same formatting conventions apply.</div>

* Use single quotes, not double quotes, around strings. — Even when the string contains `'`, which should be escaped.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    # GOOD:
    'text'
    'text with \'quotes\''

    # BAD:
    "text"
    "text with 'quotes'"
    r'(text with 'quotes')'
    ```

   <div class="rationale">**Rationale:** raw strings cannot be used since ‘box’ supports R versions pre R 4.0.</div>

* Use four spaces for indentation. Do *not* add extra spaces to align assignments or named function call arguments.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    # GOOD:
    first = 1
    second = 2

    # BAD:
    first  = 1
    second = 2
    ```

* The line length is hard-limited to 120 columns. *Most* lines should be shorter, but there is no (soft, or otherwise) limit at 80 columns.

* Explicitly use integer literals where the logical type of the expression is integer.

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
    # GOOD:
    if (length(x) == 0L) {}

    # BAD:
    if (length(x) == 0) {}
    ```


```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# nolint end
```
