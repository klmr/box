\title{Register S3 methods}
\usage{
\special{box::register_S3_method(name, class, method)}
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{the name of the generic as a character string.}

\item{class}{the class name.}

\item{method}{the method to register (optional).}
}
\value{
\code{box::register_S3_method} is called for its side effect.
}
\description{
\code{box::register_S3_method} makes an S3 method for a given generic and
class known inside a module.
}
\details{
If \code{method} is missing, it defaults to a function named
\code{name.class} in the calling module. If no such function exists, an error
is raised.

Methods for generics defined in the same module do not need to be registered
explicitly, and indeed \emph{should not} be registered. However, if the user
wants to add a method for a known generic (defined outside the module, e.g.
\code{\link{print}}), then this needs to be made known explicitly.

See the vignette at \code{vignette('box', 'box')} for more information about
defining S3 methods inside modules.
}
\note{
\strong{Do not} call \code{\link[base]{registerS3method}} inside a
module, only use \code{box::register_S3_method}. This is important for the
moduleâ€™s own book-keeping.
